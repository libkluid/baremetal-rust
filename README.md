# Baremetal Rust

**Baremetal Rust** is a project for writing firmware for embedded systems in pure Rust, without the use of an SDK. It focuses on low-level programming and direct interaction with hardware, This project serves as a practical introduction to system programming, allowing developers to work with hardware at the most fundamental level.

## Project Goals

- **Firmware Development in Pure Rust**: Write embedded firmware using Rust, without any SDKs or external libraries.  
- **Low-Level System Programming**: Learn the ins and outs of system programming by interacting directly with the hardware, such as GPIO, UART, and timers.  
- **Embedded Systems Optimization**: Write optimized code to run on constrained environments (e.g., limited memory and processing power).  
- **Leverage Rustâ€™s Safety and Performance**: Utilize Rust's memory safety guarantees and performance benefits for embedded systems development.

## Key Features

- **Hardware Control**: Directly interact with hardware peripherals such as GPIOs, UART, and timers using Rust.
- **Bare-Metal Bootstrapping**: Implement system initialization and booting from scratch without relying on any operating system or bootloader.
- **Performance Optimization**: Write optimized, efficient code that takes into account memory constraints and real-time performance.
- **Embedded Systems Fundamentals**: Work with memory-mapped registers, interrupt handling, and low-level hardware initialization.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: The project is written entirely in Rust, leveraging its features like memory safety and zero-cost abstractions.
- **Bare-Metal Programming**: No operating system or SDK is used; the code runs directly on the hardware.
